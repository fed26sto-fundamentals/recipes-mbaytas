        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This delicious stuffed eggplant with a cheesy top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.

            <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
